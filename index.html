			<p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a best friend who I met her in a long time ago. Her name is piano. And I also had an awsome teacher to teach my piano. I am grateful I could meet my piano teacher, he taught me a lot, the most impressed thing I can remember is he taught me never give up in any case.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why I say this? Because as we all know that no matter what things we do, we need to spend lots of time and energy on these things. So, when I was young, I had passion for everything, but I lacked willpower. I remember once when I played the piano, I heard other children’s laughter from the outside since they were playing some interesting games. When I heard that I found this song that I was playing is so boring and I was angry since why they can play, but I need to practice. This day was also the day the teacher needed to come my home. Therefore, I told him what I thought, at that time, I thought he would be angry, but he calmly told me “everything is boring, only when you got some successes, you would know the efforts were not in vain. As well as climbing, if you don’t reach the peak, how do you know the beauty of the landscape? But on the way of climbing is boring, because maybe the scenery is not good, and your friends may not come with you.”</p>
			<p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, I cannot deeply understand this sentence, but in the next several days or months, the teacher told me the truth gradually, so that I understand I cannot give up anything that I need to do or I want to do. Now, sometimes I will cherish the memory of practicing playing the piano, miss time that I waiting for the teacher comes in the afternoon at the weekend, and I miss the elegant piano teacher very much!</p>
